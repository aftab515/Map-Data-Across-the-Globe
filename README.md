# FCC: Map Data Across the Globe

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/aftab515/pen/BaPdxrQ](https://codepen.io/aftab515/pen/BaPdxrQ).

User Story: I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.

User Story: I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.

User Story: I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json
